# Loan Repayment Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan repayment outcomes using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify whether a borrower will fully repay a loan or default based on various financial and demographic features.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Model performance comparison using different metrics
- Deployment-ready pipeline for loan repayment prediction

## Dataset
The dataset contains borrower details, financial records, and loan information. Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

## Results
The trained model achieves competitive performance in predicting loan repayment status. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are evaluated and compared across different models.
